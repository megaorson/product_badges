## Badge module
- video instruction how to use https://www.loom.com/share/fcd4d744bea24dc8bf0e7037e85cce28
- module made on fast hand, mage2gen
- some parts was skip (optimization, styling, event some admin field type, recommendation, etc).
- check on errors skip. 
- I just don't have more time for test task, 24h it's not realistic for test task but I did all what I can for now.
- but main function was done, grid on admin + add\update\delete badges and view them on PDP(Product Detail Page) or PLP (Product List Page)
